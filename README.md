# Introduction
This project was develop by next.js@14.2.3 + react@18 + tailwind@3.4.1 + TypeScript@5

It was developed and deployed independently by my personally, i use it to become familiar with next.js, I will also
share the problems encountered and the solutions I come up with during future development here.

## The Problem I'm facing now
1. MongoDB Cloud cant connect,maybe due the params modified by the MongoDB cloud are wrong.
2. The third-party authentication function of the OAuth plugin needs to go to the third party to configure the authentication. Now I'm configuring Google Cloud OAth.
